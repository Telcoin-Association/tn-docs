# RPC Methods

### Introduction

Telcoin Network, just like Ethereum, uses a JSON-RPC specification which allows software applications to interact with the blockchain - either by reading data or sending transactions to the blockchain.

Each Telcoin Network node runs code that implements a JSON-RPC specification, meaning there is a uniform set of methods users and developers can use to interact with the blockchain.

This uniform set of methods is laid out in this section. It should act as a reference point for users and developers alike.
