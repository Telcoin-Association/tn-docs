# eth\_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex

#### Parameters

`DATA`, 32 Bytes - The hash of a block.

`QUANTITY` - The uncle's index position.

#### Returns

* `hash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the block. `null` when its pending block.
* `parentHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the parent block.
* `nonce`: `DATA`, 8 Bytes - hash of the generated proof-of-work. `null` when its pending block.
* `sha3Uncles`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - SHA3 of the uncles data in the block.
* `logsBloom`: `DATA`, 256 Bytes - the bloom filter for the logs of the block. `null` when its pending block.
* `transactionsRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - the root of the transaction trie of the block.
* `stateRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - the root of the final state trie of the block.
* `receiptsRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - the root of the receipts trie of the block.
* `miner`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - the address of the beneficiary to whom the mining rewards were given.
* `difficulty`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the difficulty for this block.
* `totalDifficulty`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the total difficulty of the chain until this block.
* `extraData`: `DATA` - the "extra data" field of this block.
* `size`: `QUANTITY` - integer the size of this block in bytes.
* `gasLimit`: `QUANTITY` - the maximum gas allowed in this block.
* `gasUsed`: `QUANTITY` - the total used gas by all transactions in this block.
* `timestamp`: `QUANTITY` - the unix timestamp for when the block was collated.
* `transactions`: `Array` - Array of transaction objects, or 32 Bytes transaction hashes depending on the last given parameter.
* `uncles`: `Array` - Array of uncle hashes.
