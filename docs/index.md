# Overview

Telcoin Network is an EVM-compatible, public blockchain secured by GSMA Operator Member Mobile Network Operators globally using proof of stake consensus. The system serves as underlying blockchain architecture securing private property rights over digital assets and enabling on-chain protocols and applications such as TELx.

This documentation is designed to help familiarize builders with the Telcoin Network. It gives background on the tech behind the Telcoin Network, contains a full list of methods supported by the network, and provides some tutorials for developing some initial projects.

Brief run downs of the docs sections are given below:

* Getting Started - Guides to help developers start building with Telcoin Network.
  * Reading Blockchain Data - An overview of the simplest types of blockchain interactions.
  * Writing to Blockchain - Mastered reading data from the blockchain? Let's start writing.
  * Dapp Development - Let's start building decentralized apps!
* Networks and RPC Endpoints - Reference documentation for connecting to Telcoin Network.
* RPC Methods - Reference documentation providing information on interacting with nodes.

### Windows users

Windows users are strongly advised to use WSL2. Start with these [instructions on installing WSL2 ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install)and then follow this [tutorial ](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2)to set it up to work with VS Code (If VS Code is your preferred IDE).

WSL2 gives a linux style environment and avoids some compatibility issues with Windows systems.

!!! warning
All commands throughout the documentation will be focused on use with Unix-like (e.g. WSL2) systems.
