# Faucet

**1. Visit the Telcoin Network TEL Faucet**

Visit[ https://telcoin.network/faucet](https://telcoin.network/faucet) on a desktop browser.

Mobile users may need to follow a different procedure based on their mobile wallet application. For example, MetaMask users [must access the faucet webpage from the MetaMask application browser](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/how-to-use-the-metamask-mobile-browser/) in order to interact with the faucet.

**2. Press "Connect Wallet" Button**

Select the wallet you would like to connect.

If your preferred wallet isn't on the list, use WalletConnect to see additional supported wallets.

You may need to select "View All" to find wallets that are installed as browser extension or desktop applications. Mobile-based wallets are also supported through WalletConnect.

**3. Request Tokens**

Click on the “Request Tokens” button. The faucet will then send a specific amount of testnet tokens to the connected wallet's address.

Users may need to import tokens to see updated balances in their wallets. If large amounts of testnet tokens are needed for your project, please email support@telcoin.org for further assistance!

**4. Check Your Wallet**

Open your wallet, and you should see the testnet tokens with an increased balance.
